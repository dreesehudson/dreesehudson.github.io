            <h2>Week 4 - JavaScript (Round 2)</h2>
            <h4>
                <date>9/19/2020</date>
            </h4>
            <p>
                It's the final day of Prework! While it has felt like I've been drinking straight from a firehose up until now, I know 
                that the intensity is about to jump up to another level. It was a huge benefit to have a small background in the different
                topics that we have been we learning about in Prework because of the Intro to Web Development class, but there were still new problems to solve 
                with each and every topic. My biggest challenge was being able to debug and understand why JavaScript was not working as anticipated or 
                understanding what different error codes mean. I overcame these obstacles through a myriad of different strategies that were
                discussed throughout the course thus far. Some problems required more reading and research, some just needed a slowdown to digest 
                what the code says, and sometimes reaching out for help was the right answer. As I said in a previous post, the willingness of the 
                group and instructors to help each other on any and all topics is very encouraging and promising for the rest of the bootcamp.
                <!-- What was one thing you liked and disliked about each of the new topics covered in Pre Work? Github, HTML, CSS, JS
                What was helpful? Eloquent JS, Help Channel, Instructors
                What hindered your progress? JS's lack of easy-to-understand feedback
                How did you overcome challenges? Reading, lots of reading. Other problem solving methods including rubber duck, pseudocode, etc.-->

            <h2>Week 3 - Intro to JavaScript</h2>
            <h4>
                <date>9/11/2020</date>
            </h4>
            <p>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript each provide important layers to both the user and the developer for any
                website. If a developer were to omit any one of these technologies
                from their website it would stand out as insufficient in the modern web environment. A website would have
                no content without HTML. It would be lifeless and boring without CSS.
                And JavaScript is needed to make websites come alive and do something besides present content.
                JavaScript allows developers to create animations, create programs
                that do a myriad number of actions, be able to call other servers to utilize external API's, manipulate
                data, and many, many other functions that are far beyond
                my novice understanding of JavaScript at this point.
            </p>

            <p>So far, my blog uses a very few objects, but I do have a few examples: images, iframes, and anchors
                (links). I plan on moving my navigation bar behind a menu button object which will show/hide the site navigation.

            <h2>Week 2 - HTML, CSS, and Pseudocode</h2>
            <h4>
                <date>9/4/2020</date>
            </h4>
            <p>I've learned and re-learned a lot of content this week. Since I already had a small base of knowledge
                about HTML and CSS from Awesome Inc's Into to Web Development course,
                I decided to approach the material as if I had not read them before and made thorough notes that could
                be used as a quick reference guide. I find that writing also helps me
                to retain information better, rather than just reading it.
            </p>
            <p>The new concept for me this week has been pseudocoding. I can definitely see how pseudocoding is an
                invaluable tool for programming, but also one
                that takes a great deal of experience to improve your skill at it. Once I decided my topic for the
                pseudocode assignment, I began mapping out the different functions, objects,
                variables, and behaviors for how each of these parts would work together to achieve my desired outcome.
                The scope quickly ballooned far beyond what I had anticipated.
                My challenge then turned to working out how the different parts of the program would fit along the
                MoSCoW rubric. Some things were easy to mark as &quot;Won't Do&quot;
                or &quot;Could Do&quot; because they would be far too time consuming or complex to work out their
                behavior. Others were harder to know where exactly to assign.
                My markdown file ended up being much longer than I had anticipated at the start of the project, but as I
                re-evaluated my work I couldn't see how to remove or simplify any
                sections without leaving a big unexplained hole in the code. I'm sure that with more experience, this
                will become more apparent and easier.
            </p>
            <p>Next week I'm excited to start adding JavaScript to our toolbelt and starting to turn the pseudocode into
                functional
                code so that we can begin to add some dynamics to our web pages and bring them up to par with what is
                expected in modern web sites.

            <h2>Week 1 - My First Blog Post!</h2>
            <h4>
                <date>8/27/2020</date>
            </h4>
            <p>The first week of bootcamp has been full of ups and downs, aha moments and bouts of confusion. </p>
            <p>I've been very grateful for how responsive and eager everyone is to jump in to tackle problems in the
                help
                channel. The fact that we're all brand new to this field but still working through problems together and
                actually
                finding solutions is very encouraging. My first major aha moment was when I was able to understand the
                proper order of operations and terminology of Git. My inital understanding of the process was that the
                pull request started your local branch, then you would make your changes on your local server, commit
                the
                changes locally, and push your commits back up to the remote server. After reviewing the documentation
                and exercises again I
                now see how these commands truly work:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>$git branch</code> : will open a new branch in your repo</li>
                <li><code>$git fetch</code> : will scan a remote server for differences between your local repo and the
                    remote repo</li>
                <li><code>$git pull</code> : will actually download the commits that you do not have in your local repo
                </li>
                <li><code>$git merge</code> : will combine your changes into the master both locally and remotely</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Next week I'm looking forward to knocking off the rust and continuing to build on the knowledge of HTML
                and
                CSS that
                I learned in the Intro to Web Developement class this past spring.</p>
