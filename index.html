        <p>The first week of bootcamp has been full of ups and downs, aha moments and bouts of confusion. </p>
        <p>I've been very grateful for how responsive and eager everyone is to jump in to tackle problems in the help channel. 
            The fact that we're all brand new to this field but still working through problems together and actually finding 
            solutions is very encouraging. My first major aha moment was when I was able to understand the 
            proper order of operations on how to make changes to the master branch. My inital understanding was that the 
            pull request started your local branch, then you would make your changes locally, commit the changes, and push
            your commits back up to the remote server. After reviewing the documentation and exercises again I now see how 
            these commands truly work:</p> 
          <ul>
            <li><code>$git branch</code>: will open a new branch in your repo</li>
            <li><code>$git fetch</code>: will scan a remote server for differences between your local repo and the remote repo</li>
            <li><code>$git pull</code>: will actually download the commits that you do not have in your local repo</li>
            <li><code>$git merge</code>: will combine your changes into the master both locally and remotely</li>
          </ul>
        <p>Next week I'm looking forward to knocking off the rust and continuing to build on the knowledge of HTML and CSS that 
            I learned in the Intro to Web Developement class this past spring.</p>
