                            It was very exciting to get started with the in-person portion of the bootcamp this week.
                            Setting up the learning space in a way to maximize our capability to learn was very
                            beneficial, but I think one drawback that each student faced was the tendency to compare
                            each other's progress or starting point against each other. By the end of the week, through
                            different exercises and the very impactful discussion led by Dr. Murphy, I think the entire
                            cohort was able to lower our guard and fear of showing weakness which will give every one of
                            us the ability to progess at a greater rate and become better programmers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm looking forward to learn more about how to utilize JavaScript and JSON to bring data
                            from external sources to make our websites more beneficial and serve a purpose besides
                            displaying hard coded information. I'd also like to continue learning about how to better
                            utilize Bootstrap to work with images. I have a basic understanding but that was the main
                            area where I found myself falling back to using custom CSS to handle image formatting.

                        <p>It's the final day of Prework! While it has felt like I've been drinking straight from a
                            firehose up until now, I know that the intensity is about to jump up to another level. It
                            was a huge benefit to have a small background in the different topics that we have been we
                            learning about in Prework because of the Intro to Web Development class, but there were
                            still new problems to solve with each and every topic. My biggest challenge was being able
                            to debug and understand why JavaScript was not working as anticipated or understanding what
                            different error codes mean. I overcame these obstacles through a myriad of different
                            strategies that were discussed throughout the course thus far. Some problems required more
                            reading and research, some just needed a slowdown to digest what the code says, and
                            sometimes reaching out for help was the right answer. As I said in a previous post, the
                            willingness of the group and instructors to help each other on any and all topics is very
                            encouraging and promising for the rest of the bootcamp.</p>

                        <p>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript each provide important layers to both the user and the
                            developer for any website. If a developer were to omit any one of these technologies
                            from their website it would stand out as insufficient in the modern web environment.
                            A website would have no content without HTML. It would be lifeless and boring without CSS.
                            And JavaScript is needed to make websites come alive and do something besides
                            present content.
                            JavaScript allows developers to create animations, create programs
                            that do a myriad number of actions, be able to call other servers to utilize
                            external API's, manipulate data, and many, many other functions that are far beyond
                            my novice understanding of JavaScript at this point.

                        <p>So far, my blog uses a very few objects, but I do have a few examples: images,

                            anchors

                        <p>I've learned and re-learned a lot of content this week. Since I already had a small base of
                            knowledge
                            about HTML and CSS from Awesome Inc's Into to Web Development course,
                            I decided to approach the material as if I had not read them before and made thorough notes
                            that could
                            be used as a quick reference guide. I find that writing also helps me
                            to retain information better, rather than just reading it.
                        </p>
                        <p>The new concept for me this week has been pseudocoding. I can definitely see how pseudocoding
                            is an
                            invaluable tool for programming, but also one
                            that takes a great deal of experience to improve your skill at it. Once I decided my topic
                            for the
                            pseudocode assignment, I began mapping out the different functions, objects,
                            variables, and behaviors for how each of these parts would work together to achieve my
                            desired outcome.
                            The scope quickly ballooned far beyond what I had anticipated.
                            My challenge then turned to working out how the different parts of the program would fit
                            along the
                            MoSCoW rubric. Some things were easy to mark as &quot;Won't Do&quot;
                            or &quot;Could Do&quot; because they would be far too time consuming or complex to work out
                            their
                            behavior. Others were harder to know where exactly to assign.
                            My markdown file ended up being much longer than I had anticipated at the start of the
                            project, but as I
                            re-evaluated my work I couldn't see how to remove or simplify any
                            sections without leaving a big unexplained hole in the code. I'm sure that with more
                            experience, this
                            will become more apparent and easier.
                        </p>
                        <p>Next week I'm excited to start adding JavaScript to our toolbelt and starting to turn the
                            pseudocode into
                            functional
                            code so that we can begin to add some dynamics to our web pages and bring them up to par
                            with what is
                            expected in modern web sites.

                        <p>The first week of bootcamp has been full of ups and downs, aha moments and bouts of
                            confusion. </p>
                        <p>I've been very grateful for how responsive and eager everyone is to jump in to tackle
                            problems in the
                            help
                            channel. The fact that we're all brand new to this field but still working through
                            problems
                            together and
                            actually
                            finding solutions is very encouraging. My first major aha moment was when I was able to
                            understand the
                            proper order of operations and terminology of Git. My inital understanding of the
                            process
                            was that the
                            pull request started your local branch, then you would make your changes on your local
                            server, commit
                            the
                            changes locally, and push your commits back up to the remote server. After reviewing the
                            documentation
                            and exercises again I
                            now see how these commands truly work:</p>

                                : will scan a remote server for differences between your local
                                repo and the

                            <li><span class="badge badge-pill badge-dark"><code class="bg-dark">$git pull</code></span>
                                : will actually download the commits that you do not have in your
                                local repo

                                : will combine your changes into the master both locally and
