            <h2>Week 2 - HTML, CSS, and Pseudocode</h2>
            <h4>
                <date>9/4/2020</date>
            </h4>
            <p>I've learned and re-learned a lot of content this week. Since I already had a small base of knowledge
                about HTML and CSS from Awesome Inc's Into to Web Development course,
                I decided to approach the material as if I had not read them before and made thorough notes that could
                be used as a quick reference guide. I find that writing also helps me
                to retain information better, rather than just reading it.
            </p>
            <p>The new concept for me this week has been pseudocoding. I can definitely see how pseudocoding is an
                invaluable tool for programming, but also one
                that takes a great deal of experience to improve your skill at it. Once I decided my topic for the
                pseudocode assignment, I began mapping out the different functions, objects,
                variables, and behaviors for how each of these parts would work together to achieve my desired outcome.
                The scope quickly ballooned far beyond what I had anticipated.
                My challenge then turned to working out how the different parts of the program would fit along the
                MoSCoW rubric. Some things were easy to mark as &quot;Won't Do&quot;
                or &quot;Could Do&quot; because they would be far too time consuming or complex to work out their
                behavior. Others were harder to know where exactly to assign.
                My markdown file ended up being much longer than I had anticipated at the start of the project, but as I
                re-evaluated my work I couldn't see how to remove or simplify any
                sections without leaving a big unexplained hole in the code. I'm sure that with more experience, this
                will become more apparent and easier.
            </p>
            <p>Next week I'm excited to start adding JavaScript to our toolbelt and starting to turn the pseudocode into functional
                code so that we can begin to add some dynamics to our web pages and bring them up to par with what is expected in modern web sites.

            <h2>My First Blog Post!</h2>
            <h4>
                <date>8/27/2020</date>
            </h4>
            <p>The first week of bootcamp has been full of ups and downs, aha moments and bouts of confusion. </p>
            <p>I've been very grateful for how responsive and eager everyone is to jump in to tackle problems in the
                help
                channel. The fact that we're all brand new to this field but still working through problems together and
                actually
                finding solutions is very encouraging. My first major aha moment was when I was able to understand the
                proper order of operations and terminology of Git. My inital understanding of the process was that the
                pull request started your local branch, then you would make your changes on your local server, commit
                the
                changes locally, and push your commits back up to the remote server. After reviewing the documentation
                and exercises again I
                now see how these commands truly work:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>$git branch</code> : will open a new branch in your repo</li>
                <li><code>$git fetch</code> : will scan a remote server for differences between your local repo and the
                    remote repo</li>
                <li><code>$git pull</code> : will actually download the commits that you do not have in your local repo
                </li>
                <li><code>$git merge</code> : will combine your changes into the master both locally and remotely</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Next week I'm looking forward to knocking off the rust and continuing to build on the knowledge of HTML
                and
                CSS that
                I learned in the Intro to Web Developement class this past spring.</p>
