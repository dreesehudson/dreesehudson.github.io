    <p>The first week of bootcamp has been full of ups and downs, aha moments and bouts of confusion. </p>
    <p>I've been very grateful for how responsive and eager everyone is to jump in to tackle problems in the help
        channel.
        The fact that we're all brand new to this field but still working through problems together and actually
        finding
        solutions is very encouraging. My first major aha moment was when I was able to understand the
        proper order of operations and terminology of Git. My inital understanding of the process was that the
        pull request started your local branch, then you would make your changes on your local server, commit the
        changes locally,
        and push your commits back up to the remote server. After reviewing the documentation and exercises again I
        now see how
        these commands truly work:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>$git ÃŸbranch</code> : will open a new branch in your repo</li>
        <li><code>$git fetch</code> : will scan a remote server for differences between your local repo and the
            remote repo</li>
        <li><code>$git pull</code> : will actually download the commits that you do not have in your local repo</li>
        <li><code>$git merge</code> : will combine your changes into the master both locally and remotely</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Next week I'm looking forward to knocking off the rust and continuing to build on the knowledge of HTML and
        CSS that
        I learned in the Intro to Web Developement class this past spring.</p>
